## **FAFSA UUID Search tool**
This tool allows searching a CSV file of up to 10 million UUIDs.

## Getting Started
This standalone tool can intake a CSV file of up to 10 million UUIDs with a `.csv` extension, and display search results in a simple browser-based user interface.

1.  Select the [`fafsa-uuid-search.html`](./fafsa-uuid-search.html) file and click the "Download raw file" button in the upper right menu.
2. Open `fafsa-uuid-search.html` in a browser (Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge preferred). You do not have to be connected to the internet to open the tool in a browser.
3. Load the CSV file provided by FSA (once the file has been decrypted and unzipped) using the "Choose Files" button in the user interface. Once loaded, you may begin searching for UUIDs.

## Standalone Design

We designed this tool to be easily downloaded and used offline. All dependencies are bundled into the single standalone file. Those dependencies are also included in the [./js](./js) folder for inspection and review.
