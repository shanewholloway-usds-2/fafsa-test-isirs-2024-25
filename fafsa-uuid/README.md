## **FAFSA UUID Search tool**
This tool allows searching a CSV file of up to 10 million UUIDs.

## Getting Started
This standalone tool can intake a CSV file of up to 10 million UUIDs with a `.csv` extension, and display search results in a simple browser-based user interface.

1.  Select the [`fafsa-uuid-search.html`](./fafsa-uuid-search.html) file and click the "Download raw file" in the upper right menu.
2. Open `fafsa-uuid-search.html` in a browser (Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge preferred). You do not have to be connected to the internet to open the tool in a browser.
3. Use _"Select CSV provided by FSA containing FAFSA UUIDs"_ to load the decrypted and unzipped file.


## Standalone Design

We designed this tool to be easily downloaded and used offline. All dependencies are bundled into the single standalone file. Those dependencies are also included in the [./js](./js) folder for inspection and review.
